description: Synthesize a completed grilling conversation into a PRD. Do not interview or publish to an issue tracker; write the PRD artifact from existing context and hand it to the spec-audit loop.
---

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a PRD. Do NOT interview the user; synthesize what you already know. If a decision is missing, record it as an assumption or open question in the PRD instead of stopping to ask.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided by the repository's own docs or
prior Killhouse stages. In the Killhouse pipeline, do not publish to an issue tracker and do not apply
triage labels; the PRD artifact is the handoff.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the PRD, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which the feature should be tested. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Record seam assumptions explicitly. Do not check with the user during this skill; the post-grill gate is the last interactive alignment point before PRD synthesis.

3. Write the PRD using the template below. Save it as a PRD artifact or return the artifact path if the runtime already has one. Do not publish it to an issue tracker and do not mutate labels.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this PRD.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.

## Assumptions and Open Questions

Known assumptions made during synthesis, plus any open questions the spec-audit loop or `ask-kh` must
surface before implementation if they are material.

## Killhouse handoff

> Vendored from `mattpocock/skills` (MIT — see `skills/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSE-mattpocock.txt`) and adapted for Killhouse; customize freely.

Reach this stage only through the post-grill gate. A PRD written before grilling converges encodes the
misalignment the grilling exists to remove. The finished PRD is the document handed to
`loops/REVIEW_DOCUMENT` (the 9-subagent spec audit), which converges it before `loops/PLAN`. Control returns
to `ask-kh`, which either advances directly into the spec audit in Autopilot or stops at the checkpoint first
in Checkpoint mode.
